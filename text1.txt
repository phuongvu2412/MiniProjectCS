Cloud computing has been around for approximately two decades and despite the data pointing to the business efficiencies, cost benefits and competitive advantages it holds over the old way of business, a large portion of the business community continues to operate the old way. According to a study by the International Data Group, 69 percent of businesses are already using cloud technology in one capacity or another, and 18 percent say they plan to implement cloud-computing solutions at some point. At the same time, Dell reports that companies that invest in big data, cloud, mobility, and security enjoy up to 53 percent faster revenue growth than their competitors. As this data clearly shows, an increasing number of tech-savvy businesses and industry leaders are recognising the many benefits of the cloud computing trend. But more than that, they are using this technology to more efficiently run their organisations, better serve their customers, and dramatically increase their overall profit margins.
